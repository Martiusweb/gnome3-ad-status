# alwaysdata status extension

This extension will be useless to you as-is, but you can fork it!

# Requirements

Python 3, sleekxmpp, dbus-python (>= 1.0, usually installed on a linux desktop).

# Reminders

Hey myself, don't forget about where to look for the logs:

   journalctl /usr/bin/gnome-session -f -o cat
